How to build

Gather dependancies:

```
% git submodule init
% git submodule update
```

```
% git submodule update --init --recursive
% cmake .
% make
% make check
```

Building the software requires OpenSSL 1.0.2 or above.
If you have OpenSSL installed in a non-standard directory, you can pass the location using the `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable.

```
% PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/openssl/lib/pkgconfig cmake .
```
